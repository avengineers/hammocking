Usage
=====

Command line
------------

Before we integrate it into the build chain of your choice it is a good idea to call it on the command line
in order to gather more understanding what it does and what it needs.

Let's call hammocking without any arguments:

..  code-block:: shell

    $ python -m hammocking
    usage: hammocking [-h] (--symbols SYMBOLS [SYMBOLS ...] | --plink PLINK) --outdir OUTDIR --sources SOURCES [SOURCES ...] [--except EXCLUDES ...]
    hammocking: error: the following arguments are required: --outdir/-o, --sources

hammocking needs ...

* *--sources*: The list of paths to source files which represent your item-under test. (In classic unittest it is just one)
* Either ...
   * --symbols*: comma seperated list of symbol names which are to mock or
   * *--plink*: path to the object file which contains the unresolved symbols to mock
* *--outdir*: An existing directory where to write code files containing mockup code.
* *--except*: if a symbol is found in a header of these directories, it will not be mocked. Use this to exclude symbols from mocking that will be provided by libraries in the linking process.
  (Defaults to ``/usr/include`` for system headers)

One compilation unit
--------------------

We show this scenario for explanation purpose only. The next chapter shows the common way and covers the one compilation unit as well.
